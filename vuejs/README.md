# Vue JS
#### A brief tutorial

VueJs is a progressive JavaScript framework mainly to code the view part of MVC. It is used for building user interfaces and single page applications.

VueJS uses an-HTML based syntax that allows binding the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instance data.

Vue components extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. At a high level, components are custom elements to which the Vueâ€™s compiler attaches behavior. In Vue, a component is essentially a Vue instance with pre-defined options.

By far, Vue Js is the easiest JavaScript framework to learn and work with.

First, we must ensure that our device can run nodeJs environment. If you are using Windows, please install Windows Linux Sub-system first.

To know whether node is installed, run this on the terminal:

>`node -v`

it will return the current node version running on the machine. If node is not installed try installing it using:

#### Ubuntu

1. Add NodeJS PPA

install curl
> `sudo apt install curl`

then the PPA (latest)
> `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -`

or the LTS PPA
> `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo bash -`
