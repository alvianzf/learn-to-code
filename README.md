This is the repo for learning how to code. The lessons are divided into several categories for easy reading. The lessons also includes some test scripts and sample codes to better understand the concept

### Algorithms

![algorithm](img/alg.png)

Algorithms are a set of commands or rules that if run correctly, will produce consistent result everytime it is executed.
In programming, an algorithm is expressed through a specific syntax that corresponds to the programming language (or prolang to be short) and will always produce the same output given the same input.

Let's take a look at some algorithm practices using JavaScript to help you better understand the concept and shape the way to approach a problem. Remember, there is no *right way* to approach a problem. But, there is a *best practice* so that other programmers will understand easily what we have done and what we aim to achieve.

#### Javascript

understanding JavaScript it essential to a successful web developer. Most of the scripts witten nowadays, especially in **Front end** development are written mostly, if not entirely in JavaScript. That's why, a deep understanding of JavaScript is very important. JavaScript is light-weight, versatile, and quite easy to understand.

for further reading, you can catch up to JavaScript [here](https://www.javascript.com/).

#### Prequisites

![git](/img/git-logo.png)

You should be able to use `git` for this lesson. At least you should be able to create a new branch, `checkout`, `clone`, `pull`, `add`, `commit`, and `push` your code to the repo. If you are unfamilliar with git, you could learn all about it [here](https://github.com/alvianzf/learn-to-code/tree/master/git/README.md)

#### Let's get started
