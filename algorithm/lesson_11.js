// working with Array

/**
 * Array, simply put, is a collection of data
 * 
 * it is identified by the use of the square brackets [...]
 * Each element in the array has an index that states the location of the data in the array
 * the index starts from 0 and in an increment of 1
 * 
 */

 let arrayExample = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth']

/**
 * The indexes are:
 * 0: first
 * 1: second
 * 2: third
 * 3: fourth
 */

 /**
  * To know the length of the array, we use the length() function
  */

  let len = arrayExample.length

  /**
   * To access the element in the array, we can access it using the square brackets
   */

   let firstElement = arrayExample[0]

   /**
    * Assignment:
    * 
    * 1. Try to access the second and fourth data of the taskArray
    * 2. Try to console.log each of the array's element (hint: try using for)
