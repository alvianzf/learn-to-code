/**
 * a console.log is a powerful debugging tool that will help you in more ways than one
 * it is used to print out anything, from a variable, to an abject to your console in realtime!

 // we define a variable first:

 let str = 'Coding is fun?'

 console.log(str)
 // this will print out the value of the str variable

 //let's change the content

 str = 'Yes, it is!'

 console.log(str)
